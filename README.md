# Zhengzhou_2019_survey
This repo contains two survey questionnaires from the travel behavior survey executed by the MIT Sustainable Urbanization Lab in Zhengzhou, China during July 2019:

1) survey for car commuters
2) survey for non-car commuters

A pre-screening (included as the first section of each of the posted surveys) was used to determine which set of questions each respondent received.
